# Primary Features of Team Roster
This is a fun, team-oriented application, allowing a user to create their dream team! Whatever that may be. The application allows for a user to create members or players for their team. The site also allows for a user to delete that member/player, or to update their information as the user sees fit. This application serves to entertain those who want to visualize and place their favorite team members/players on one team, customizing as they go along. 

# Target Audience for Team Roster
Sports lovers would love an application like Team Roster. We all discuss how amazing certain teams would be if specific players were on one team, displaying their strengths for domination. Great for those who want to visualize their dream team.
